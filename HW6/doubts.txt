CV HW6

Train 1469, 02378 -> error in printing, plot image error

Frozen layers is just including those two lines

-> What are the deliverables:-

	-> What is test loss curve? (just numbers or image)

	-> What to deliver for dropout regularization (new test accuracy, activation maps?)
       	It is just rerunning the same code with one line added for 3 layers

	-> Is final execution graph the one I am getting?

	-> Confirm filter maps (activations) for conv1, conv2 and pool
	    Specially pool for which I am using pool3/pool/MaxPool:0


What all parameters should be tuned to get test accuracy > 99%
